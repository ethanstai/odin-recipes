            <li>Onion and garlic</li>
            <li>Carrot</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Roast the tomatoes by slicing them in half vertically and laying them on a parchment-lined baking sheet cut-side-up. Drizzle them with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Then, roast them at 350 degrees Farenheit for an hour</li>
            <li>Cook the onion, carrot, and garlic in a large pot over medium heat for about 8 minutes, or until they soften.</li>
            <li>Add the roasted tomatoes, broth, vinegar, and thyme leaves to the pot, bring to a boil, and simmer for 20 minutes to allow the flavors to develop.</li>
            <li>Allow the tomato basil soup to cool slightly. Transfer it to a blender and puree until smooth, working in batches if necessary.</li>
            <li>When the soup is smooth, add the basil leaves and pulse the blender until just combined. Serve and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
